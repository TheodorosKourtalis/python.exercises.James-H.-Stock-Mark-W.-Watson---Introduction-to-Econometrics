**Sample Answer:**  
Randomly assign a large group of high school students to two groups:
- **Treatment Group:** Receives a structured program that mandates six hours of reading per week.
- **Control Group:** Continues with their normal reading routine.

Measure vocabulary improvement using standardized tests administered before and after the reading program.  
**Challenges:**  
- Maintaining strict adherence to the reading schedule.  
- Accounting for external factors such as studentsâ€™ extracurricular reading habits.  
- Ethical issues related to forcing a regimented reading schedule on students.

Randomly assign participants into two groups:

- **Control Group:** Receives a placebo drink with no alcohol.

Assess memory performance using standardized cognitive tests at the beginning and end of the study period.

**Sample Answer:**  
1. **Ideal RCT:** Randomly assign workers into two groups where one group receives additional training while the other follows the standard training program. Compare productivity after the intervention.  
2. **Cross-Sectional Data:** Collect data from various firms at a single point in time on average training hours and worker productivity along with control variables such as firm size and sector.  
3. **Time Series Data:** Track productivity and training hours at one firm over many time periods (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to analyze trends and immediate impacts.  
4. **Panel Data:** Gather data from multiple firms over several years, allowing you to control for both time-invariant characteristics and changes over time, offering a richer analysis of training impacts on productivity.
