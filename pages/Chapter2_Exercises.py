1. **Standardize the value.** The z-score is:

$$
z \;=\; \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \;=\; \frac{-2 \,-\, 0}{1.2} \;\approx\; -1.67.

2. **Find the cumulative probability.** Using a standard normal table (or a calculator):

**Sample Answer:**

Let:

$$
P(\text{Disease}) \;=\; 0.01, \qquad P(\text{No Disease}) \;=\; 0.99,
$$

$$
P(\text{Test Positive}\mid\text{Disease}) \;=\; 0.98, \qquad P(\text{Test Negative}\mid\text{No Disease}) \;=\; 0.95.
$$

$$
P(\text{Test Positive} \mid \text{No Disease})
\;=\; 1 - 0.95
\;=\; 0.05.
$$

Apply **Bayesâ€™ rule**:

$$
P(\text{Disease} \mid \text{Test Positive}) 
= \frac{\,P(\text{Test Positive}\mid\text{Disease}) \,\times\, P(\text{Disease})\,}
       {\,P(\text{Test Positive})\,}.
$$

where

$$
P(\text{Test Positive}) 
= P(\text{Test Positive}\mid\text{Disease}) \,\times\, P(\text{Disease})
\;+\; P(\text{Test Positive}\mid\text{No Disease}) \,\times\, P(\text{No Disease}).
$$

Plug in the values:

$$
P(\text{Test Positive})
= (0.98 \,\times\, 0.01) \;+\; (0.05 \,\times\, 0.99)
= 0.0098 + 0.0495
= 0.0593.
$$

Hence,

$$
P(\text{Disease}\mid\text{Test Positive})
= \frac{\,0.98 \,\times\, 0.01\,}{\,0.0593\,}
\;\approx\; \frac{0.0098}{\,0.0593\,}
\;\approx\; 0.165.
$$

Thus, a person who tests positive has roughly a **16.5% chance** of actually having the disease.
