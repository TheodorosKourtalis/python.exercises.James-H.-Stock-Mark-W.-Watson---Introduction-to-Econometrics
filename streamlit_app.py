**Sample Answer:**  
One approach is to randomly select a large group of high school students and then randomly assign them into two groups.  
- The **treatment group** receives a structured program that requires six hours of reading per week using selected texts.  
- The **control group** continues with their usual reading habits.  

Vocabulary improvement is measured using a standardized vocabulary test administered at the start and end of the study period.  
**Potential impediments:**  
- **Compliance and Measurement:** Ensuring that students adhere to the prescribed six hours might be challenging.  
- **External Factors:** Differences in prior reading habits, quality of reading materials, or additional support outside school might confound the results.  
- **Ethical Concerns:** Mandating or limiting reading hours may face ethical and practical issues in a real school setting.

**Sample Answer:**  
A possible experiment would involve randomly assigning participants into two groups:  
- **Treatment Group:** Receives a controlled dose of alcohol at regular intervals.  
- **Control Group:** Receives a placebo drink with no alcohol content.  

Memory performance is tested using standardized cognitive tests before and after a long study period.  
**Potential impediments:**  
- **Ethical Concerns:** Administering alcohol, especially repeatedly over a long period, could pose health risks and ethical dilemmas.  
- **Compliance and Safety:** Ensuring participants only follow the prescribed regimen and managing adverse health events.  
- **Confounding Variables:** Individual differences in alcohol tolerance, lifestyle factors, and preexisting conditions might interfere with the results.

You are asked to study the causal effect of hours spent on employee training (measured in hours per worker per week) on the productivity of workers (output per worker per hour).  
Describe:  
a. An ideal randomized controlled experiment to measure this causal effect;  
b. An observational cross-sectional data set with which you could study this effect;  
c. An observational time series data set for studying this effect; and  
d. An observational panel data set for studying this effect.

**Sample Answer:**  
- **a. Ideal Randomized Controlled Experiment:**  
  Randomly assign workers in a manufacturing plant into two groups. The treatment group receives a structured, additional training program (extra hours of training), while the control group receives the standard training regime. After a fixed period, compare the productivity (output per worker per hour) of the two groups.

- **b. Observational Cross-Sectional Data Set:**  
  Collect data from a variety of manufacturing plants at a single point in time. For each plant, record the average training hours per worker and the corresponding productivity levels. Additional variables (like plant size and industry type) would help control for confounding factors.

- **c. Observational Time Series Data Set:**  
  Use data from one manufacturing plant over multiple time periods (e.g., monthly or quarterly data) that records the number of training hours and productivity metrics. This data set allows for time trend analysis and correlation between training changes and subsequent productivity.

- **d. Observational Panel Data Set:**  
  Gather data from multiple manufacturing plants over several time periods. This panel data can help control for unobserved heterogeneity across plants by comparing within-plant changes over time in training hours and productivity.
