Session Summary – PDF Generation from Markdown in Streamlit Cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------

In this session, we addressed a complex scenario involving the integration of a 
Streamlit application hosted on Streamlit Cloud with a dynamic PDF generation workflow. 
Our goal was to generate PDFs from Markdown content that includes both styled text 
(e.g., **bold**, *italic*) and LaTeX equations, ensuring that both types of formatting 
are rendered correctly in the final PDF output. Below is a detailed explanation of 
what we learned and why our solution works:

1. Environment and Deployment Considerations:
   ------------------------------------------------
   - **Streamlit Cloud & GitHub**: Our app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud using a GitHub 
     repository. In this environment, we need to ensure that system dependencies (like 
     a LaTeX compiler) are installed. We solved this by creating a `packages.txt` file 
     with entries such as:
         texlive-latex-base
         texlive-fonts-recommended
   - **Python Dependencies**: Our `requirements.txt` file lists the necessary Python 
     libraries (e.g., streamlit, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and fpdf). These are installed 
     automatically on deployment.

2. PDF Generation Strategy:
   -------------------------
 **Requirement**: We needed to create PDFs that correctly display both markdown styling 
     (e.g., bold/italic text) and LaTeX math.
   - **Problem**: 
     - Using libraries like fpdf directly will not process Markdown formatting (e.g., 
       **bold**) and will not render LaTeX math correctly.
     - Conversely, using matplotlib or math rendering on its own may process LaTeX math 
       correctly but lose the Markdown styling.
   - **Solution**: We decided to convert Markdown to LaTeX first. By pre-processing the 
     Markdown content:
     - We convert **bold** text to \textbf{...} and *italic* to \textit{...} 
     - We preserve math blocks (i.e., sections between $...$ or $$...$$) exactly as they are.
     - We escape special characters (such as &, %, #, _) only in the non-math portions.
   - The conversion is done via a custom Python function (using regex). We learned that 
     the order is crucial: first replace markdown markers, then escape special characters, 
     but leave math blocks intact.


3. LaTeX Document Generation and Compilation:
   ------------------------------------------------
   - Once the Markdown is converted to LaTeX, we wrap that output into a minimal LaTeX 
     document. For example, our document preamble includes:
       \documentclass[12pt]{article}
       \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
       \usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}
       \usepackage{lmodern}
       \usepackage{geometry}
       \geometry{margin=1in}
       \begin{document}
       ... converted content ...
       \end{document}
   - We then compile this LaTeX document to PDF using pdflatex via a subprocess call. 
     This ensures that both the math and the converted markdown formatting are rendered 
     correctly in the final PDF.

4. Modular Code Organization:
   ----------------------------
   - **Helper Module (latex_helpers.py)**: To avoid code duplication and ease maintenance, 
     we isolated all Markdown-to-LaTeX conversion and PDF generation functions into an 
     external file (e.g., latex_helpers.py). This module includes:
       • A function to convert Markdown to LaTeX (markdown_to_latex_fixed).
       • A function to wrap the converted text in a full LaTeX document (generate_latex_document).
       • A function to compile the LaTeX document using pdflatex and return PDF bytes (generate_pdf_with_pdflatex).
       • A function to show the sample answer: if the global “small_screen” flag is true, it 
         generates a PDF and offers a download button; otherwise, it displays the sample answer 
         as regular markdown.
   - **Chapter2_Exercises.py**: This is our main application file (placed inside the pages/ 
     folder) that imports the helper functions and uses them for each exercise’s sample 
     answer. This modular design allows easy reuse across chapters.

5. Global Small Screen Flag:
   ---------------------------
   - We introduced a global flag (stored in st.session_state) called “small_screen.” In our 
     UI, if the user selects that they are on a small screen (via a checkbox on the main 
     page), then the sample answers are rendered as downloadable PDFs (using the helper 
     functions). Otherwise, they are displayed in plain markdown. This makes the app more 
     responsive and user-friendly on different devices.

6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:
   --------------------------------
   - **Extra Braces in Output**: We learned that if the conversion produces something like 
     \textbf{{...}}, LaTeX will print the braces. We addressed this by ensuring our regex and 
     processing do not introduce redundant braces.
   - **pdflatex Errors**: If pdflatex fails, we capture and display the error output so we can 
     diagnose missing packages or syntax problems.
   - **Escaping Special Characters**: We had to carefully escape characters only in non-math 
     segments to avoid corrupting valid LaTeX commands.

7. Final Integration:
   -------------------
   - The final system consists of:
       • **generate_pdf.py**: Reads Markdown from stdin, converts it to a LaTeX document, compiles it with pdflatex, and outputs PDF bytes.
       • **latex_helpers.py**: Contains functions to convert Markdown to LaTeX and to compile PDFs.
       • **Chapter2_Exercises.py**: Our interactive Streamlit page that calls our helper functions to display sample answers, either as inline Markdown or as downloadable PDFs based on the user's device setting.
   - This modular and layered approach makes it easier to debug, maintain, and reuse the code in future chapters or projects.

To add the small-screen PDF download option for any exercise (e.g., Exercise 2.3 or later chapters):

• Import the helper function (`show_sample_answer`) from your `latex_helpers.py` module.
• In your exercise’s expander for the sample answer, call:

      show_sample_answer(sample_md)

  where `sample_md` is your Markdown string containing both text and LaTeX.
• Ensure the global `st.session_state["small_screen"]` flag is initialized (e.g., on your main page with a checkbox or default value).

This pattern allows each exercise to remain clean and focused while keeping the sample answer rendering modular, maintainable, and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

To ensure that every chapter in your application supports the small-screen PDF download option for sample answers, follow these steps:

1. Modularize the PDF Generation Logic:
   • Create a helper module (e.g., “latex_helpers.py”) that contains all the functions needed to:
     - Convert Markdown (with **bold** and *italic*, and including LaTeX math blocks) into proper LaTeX code.
     - Wrap the converted content in a complete LaTeX document.
     - Compile the document using pdflatex via a subprocess call.
     - Provide a function (show_sample_answer) that checks the global flag and either:
         ▸ Displays a download button for the generated PDF (when st.session_state["small_screen"] is True), or
         ▸ Renders the sample answer as inline Markdown.
     
2. Import the Helper in Each Chapter Script:
   • In every chapter file (e.g., Chapter2_Exercises.py, Chapter3_Exercises.py, etc.), add:
         from latex_helpers import show_sample_answer
     This makes the helper available for use across all chapters.

3. Set Up the Global Small-Screen Flag:
   • In your main page or in every chapter script’s sidebar, add a checkbox that allows the user to indicate they are on a small screen. For example:
         st.sidebar.header("Display Options")
         small_screen_flag = st.sidebar.checkbox("I'm on a small screen", value=st.session_state.get("small_screen", False))
         st.session_state["small_screen"] = small_screen_flag
   • This global flag (stored in st.session_state["small_screen"]) is then used by show_sample_answer().

4. Use the Helper Function in Each Sample Answer Expander:
   • In each exercise’s “Show Sample Answer” expander, define the sample answer as a Markdown string (sample_md).
   • Instead of using st.markdown() directly, call:
         show_sample_answer(sample_md, key_suffix="unique_id")
     where “unique_id” is a unique key (for example, "2_2" for Exercise 2.2, "2_3" for Exercise 2.3, etc.). This ensures unique widget keys and reuse of the same PDF conversion logic.

5. Reuse Across Chapters:
   • By following this pattern in every chapter script, you ensure that:
         - The code remains modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
         - New chapters will automatically support the small-screen PDF download option by simply importing and using show_sample_answer().
         - The user experience is consistent: on small screens, sample answers are offered as downloadable PDFs; on larger screens, they are displayed inline.

This approach makes it easy to maintain and extend the PDF generation functionality across all chapters. Any future chapter can simply import the helper and follow the same pattern in its sample answer expander.
